A Windows 64bit Driver for the Steel Battalion controller

This driver will let you use your old Steel Battalion controller as a USB-HID gamepad in a windows system.

## How to install the driver

Read [How to use the Steel Battalion Controller on Windows 10](https://medium.com/@oscarsc/how-to-use-the-steel-battalion-controller-on-windows-10-2e21aa8ccd28)

## Where does it work

If the game you want to use the controller with lets you configure generic gamepads or joysticks you will probably be able to use the Steel Battalion 
controller without any modifications to the game.

If you are using steam and the game only supports XInput controllers (Xbox-like gamepads) you can map the Steel Battalion
controller from the steam gamepad preferences.

## About the project

This started as a side project to enable to use the Steel Battalion controller in [BH Trials](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1067080/BH_Trials/), a game I am working on where you take the controls of a digger.

I also wrote a technical article about [Writing a driver for the Steel Battalion controller](https://medium.com/@oscarsc/writing-a-driver-for-the-steel-battalion-controller-e1e4311f1a40)
